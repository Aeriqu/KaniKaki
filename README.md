## About
This is a project that I'm using to both learn different technology stacks and kanji. The goal of this application is to provide a kanji writing practice service that can also sync with the popular kanji learning service that uses a crab-aligator as its mascot, so that the user is able to practice writing the kanji that they have learned on that platform. As such, this project is named KaniKaki.

## Project Current Status

Since this project is still under active development, the best way to keep track of the progress is by swapping over to the develop branch and taking a look!
